# Prometheus

The Prometheus plugin is used to display additional Prometheus metrics for Nodes, Deployments, StatefulSets, Pods, etc.

The plugin can be enabled in the **Settings** for the mobile and desktop version. To use the plugin in the web version you have to set the `--plugin.prometheus.enabled` flag. A detailed explanation of the each setting and the required command-line flags can be found in the respective documentation:

- [Mobile](../mobile/settings.md#prometheus)
- [Desktop](../desktop/settings.md#prometheus)
- [Web](../web/command-line-flags.md)

## Default Metrics

The Prometheus plugin supports some out of the box metrics for Nodes, Deployments, StatefulSets, Pods, etc. These metrics are generated by the [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) and the [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), which must be installed by you.
